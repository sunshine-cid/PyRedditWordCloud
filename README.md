# PyRedditWordCloud
Utilizes Python to pull reddit history from an NDJSON file into a SQL database. Creates a word frequency table, then exports data to be used by a Word Cloud.

These files have been included from the PY4E certificate course in order to simplify the code-writing process:
>d3.layout.cloud.js
>
>d3.v2.js
>
>gword.htm
>

This file has been included as a sample which will provide a visualization of my data:
>gword.js
